# Minesweeper ðŸ’£

A repository documenting the learning process for the Kotlin project *Minesweeper* from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/).

## About
This project implements the classic Minesweeper game in Kotlin. Players can:
- Choose the number of mines on the field
- Mark potential mine locations
- Explore cells they believe are safe
- Win by either marking all mines correctly or revealing all safe cells
- First move is always safe, just like the original game

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- Object-oriented programming principles in Kotlin
- Utilizing various Kotlin features for problem-solving
- While I didn't use every Kotlin feature available, I gained understanding of their benefits and applications for future use

## Gameplay
Players interact with the game through commands:
- `free`: To explore a cell you think is safe
- `mine`: To mark or unmark a cell as a potential mine location
